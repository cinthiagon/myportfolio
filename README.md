# üìë My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!

### ‚úîÔ∏è About the Project

This project was developed as part of the **[Alura Include program](https://www.alura.com.br/empresas/impacto-social)**. The program aims to help participants from underrepresented groups in tech gain the skills and knowledge to build portfolios and prepare for the tech workforce. This project showcases the **front-end skills** I have developed through the program since October 2024, including HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Features

- **Home**: A brief introduction to who I am, my professional background, and my career transition into data science.
- **Skills**: A list of the technical skills I possess, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools I use in data analysis, web development, and other fields.
- **Portfolio**: A collection of various projects I‚Äôve worked on, demonstrating my technical skills in areas like Python, SQL, JavaScript, and more.

# üöÄ Technologies and Techniques Used

### ‚úîÔ∏è HTML

- **Semantic HTML5**: the website's structure is built using semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>`. These elements improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
  
- **External Assets**: the site uses external images, linked stylesheets, and web fonts. Image assets (like icons and photographs) and external links (e.g., social media profiles) enhance the visual appeal and user experience.

- **Anchor Links**: navigation is structured with anchor links (`<a>`), facilitating easy movement between the different sections of the portfolio, such as `Home`, `Skills`, and `Portfolio` pages.

- **Responsive Layout**: the `meta viewport` tag in the `<head>` ensures the page scales correctly on different devices, making the website responsive to mobile and desktop views.

### ‚úîÔ∏è CSS

- **CSS Variables**: custom properties (CSS variables) are used to manage common design tokens such as primary and secondary colors, fonts, and overlay effects. This allows easy updates and consistency throughout the design.

- **Global Reset**: a global reset is applied to remove default browser margin and padding, ensuring consistent spacing across browsers.

- **Presentation Section**: the main presentation section uses Flexbox to arrange text and images side by side. A `::before` pseudo-element adds a semi-transparent overlay to improve text readability.
  
### ‚úîÔ∏è JAVASCRIPT

- **Dynamic text animation**: uses `setTimeout` to progressively reveal text within the `.title-highlight` element, simulating a typewriter effect.
- **Conditional logic**: fetches custom text from a meta tag (`<meta name="page-text">`), or fall back to default text if not available.
